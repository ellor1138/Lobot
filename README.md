# Lobot

## What is it?

Lobot is a [key] obfuscator plugin for ColdFusion on Wheels. This plugin offer a more secure solution to protect your application by obfuscating the [key]. The plugin create a hash of the [key] which is then encrypted with the [key] itself. On each request, the [key] is decrypted and compared to the hash value. If the comparison fails the action is aborted, otherwise the decrypted [key] is restored in the params struct.

#### Benefits of using this plugin:
* The [key] is encrypted along with the hash value for comparison
* If the comparison is successfull: The [key] is restored in the params struct
* If the comparison fails: The action is aborted
* The obfuscated [key] is impossible to guest and tampering with it will abort the action
* Based on "How to protect sensitive data in URL's" (https://www.owasp.org/index.php/How_to_protect_sensitive_data_in_URL%27s)
